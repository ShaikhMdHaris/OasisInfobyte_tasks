            Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion,
            Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick;
            he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the
            1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and was named an All-Star by his second season.
            Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA

          <p>After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the
            Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. On January 22, 2006, he scored a
            career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single NBA game, behind Wilt Chamberlain's
            100-point game. Bryant led the team to consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, both times being named
            NBA Finals MVP. He continued to be among the top players in the league through the 2012–13 season, when he
            suffered a torn achilles tendon at age 34. His next two seasons were cut short by injuries to his knee and
            shoulder, respectively. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season. In 2017, the
            Lakers retired both his #8 and #24 jerseys, making him the only player in NBA history to have multiple
            jerseys retired by the same franchise. </p>

          <h3>More Good about Kobe </h3>

          <p>The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20
            seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, and he has the most consecutive
            appearances as a starter. Bryant's four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most
            in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely
            adopted by the general public. He won gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams. In 2018, he won
            the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the film Dear Basketball (2017)</p>

          <h2>The Biggest Demise that took place in 2020 in the History of Basketball.</h2>

          <p>Bryant died, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas,
            California, in 2020.[11] A number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, including renaming the
            All-Star MVP Award in his honor</p>
